# AI Topic Analyzer with Finite State Machine

An interactive web application that analyzes text content and identifies relevant topics using AI embeddings, powered by a finite state machine architecture.

## Overview

This app processes user-provided text through a multi-stage pipeline: summarization, embedding generation, and topic scoring. The entire workflow is orchestrated using XState, providing a robust and visualized state machine that manages the analysis lifecycle.

## Features

- Real-time state machine visualization
- Client-side AI processing (no server required)
- Multi-topic similarity scoring
- Recursive text summarization for long inputs
- Interactive radar chart for topic analysis
